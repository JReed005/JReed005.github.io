        My name is Jared Blank, I have graduated from McHenry County College. I have pursued a degree in Graphic Art and obtained a Certificate in Digital Media.

        A strength that McHenry CountyCollege has helped me develop is the ability to give helpful and constructive feedback while being able to take constructive criticism so that I am always improving.

      <h1>Bio:</h1>
      <p>I am Jared Blank, I am a graduate of McHenry County College holding a degree in Graphic Design and a certificate in Digital Media. I currently have experience with all of the Adobes well-known products such as Illustrator, InDesign, After Effects, Lightroom, Premier, and Photoshop. I also have years of practice using traditional methods such as pen, pencil, and charcoal. I am a hard worker who works exceptionally well alone but does not shy away from collaborating on group tasks. I have always pulled ideas and inspiration from fantasy worlds in computer art but I'm not afraid to stay grounded with real-world ideals such as logo creation, web design, digital design, image manipulation, videography and photography.</p>
