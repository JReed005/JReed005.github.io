            TOWN combines a variety of chinese cuisine 
to excite and delight our customers. 
Our vision for the future is to create 
experiential dining that is more than just 
a night out. We aim to bring quality and 
luxury across all aspects of our brand.
The approach of TOWN is to develop our 
brand with the understanding of both our 
culture and consumer insights. Within our 
vision always lives the promise of inspiring 
creativity, conversation and quality. 
Our audience is a high-end clientele who 
values a dining experience. The age range 
of our customers are from early 30s-60s. 
We would like them to come back for both 
personal dining and events.
